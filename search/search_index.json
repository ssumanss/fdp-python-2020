Syllabus \u00b6 System of linear equation Matrix of Linear Transformation Jordan Canonical Forms Course Objectives \u00b6 The course linear algebra focussed on the study of finte dimensional vector spaces. This is the third course on linear algebra in TMBU, Bhagalpur. The first course mainly involved introductory theory of matrices. Second course is concerned about abstract vector spaces. Here we will convert any vector space into \\mathbb{R}^n and then study it's properties, mainly the linear transformation. We also study bilinear and quadratic transformation in later part of this course.
