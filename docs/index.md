# Welcome to linear algebra course

This page is dedicated to the course of linear algebra taught in the university department of mathematics, Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University, Bhagalpur.

## Syllabus

- System of linear equation
- Matrix of Linear Transformation
- Jordan Canonical Forms

## Course Objectives

The course ==linear algebra== focussed on the study of finte dimensional vector spaces. This is the third course on linear algebra in TMBU, Bhagalpur. The first course mainly involved introductory theory of matrices. Second course is concerned about abstract vector spaces. Here we will convert any vector space into $\mathbb{R}^n$ and then study it's properties, mainly the linear transformation. We also study bilinear and quadratic transformation in later part of this course. 

- [ ] Solve any system of linear equation
- [ ] Finding matrix of linear transformation
- [ ] Finding change of basis matrix 
- [ ] Compute Jordan Form of a Matrix
- [ ] Classify quadratic forms
- [ ] Matrix of bilinear forms
