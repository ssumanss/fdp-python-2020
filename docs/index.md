# Welcome to linear algebra course

This page is dedicated to the course of linear algebra taught in the university department of mathematics, Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University, Bhagalpur.

## Syllabus

- System of linear equation
- Matrix of Linear Transformation
- Jordan Canonical Forms

## Course Objectives

The course ==linear algebra== focussed on the study of properties of complex functions. This is the third course on linear algebra in TMBU, Bhagalpur. The first course mainly introduce the concept of differentiability and analyticity in complex domains. Here we will discuss the integration in the sense of complex functions.

- [ ] Understand contour integration
- [ ] Apply Cauchy integral formula
- [ ] Import results based on CIF
- [ ] Ability to represent complex function as Power and Laurents series
- [ ] Understand different type of singularity 
- [ ] Finding the integraton along closed contour
